## Question 1 

**Process Preemption**: This is the act of interrupting a running process, saving it's current state without the process approval, eith the intent of resuming the process operation at a later time.

## Question 2

**Swapping**: The process of copying out least used files or contents of an address from **RAM** to a reserved location in **Secondary Storage** called **Swap** which is a virtual extension of **RAM**.

## Question 3

**Categories of information in a process control block**
-**Process Identification**: This set of information helps us know the identity of a certain process and uniquely differentiate it from other running process. E.g Process ID, Parent ID.

-**Process State Information**: This set of information allows us to identify the state of a process and other values attributed with the running process in case an interupt occurs and it needs to be loaded back. E.g Program Couter, Registers.

-**Process Control Information**:This set of information contains details on howthe process is to be controlled, relationship to other processes and data needed.

## Question 4

**Kernel & User Mode**:  These modes are needed to provide modularity, abstraction adn protection.

-**Modularity**: To separate user activities and hardware activities. I.e prevent user changes from interfering with the workings of the system.

-**Abstraction**: Allow users to interact with hardware through a bridge using APIS's which actually refernce the kernel rather than communicating directly with the underlying hardware.

-**Protection**: Prevent users from creating irreversible damage to computer hardware, and damage made in the user space can easily be reversed, but if users were allowed to communicate directly with the hardware, crashes won't be alll that easy to recover from.

## Question 5

-**Interrupt**: Interrupts are external disruptions to the running of a process, generated by the hardware of a computer and totalyy unexpected and uncontrollable by the process. 
  **Causes of Interrupt**
  - Process waiting for I/O
  - Preemption by CPU due to higher priority processes
  - User Interrupt
  - End of program
  
-**Traps**: These are user defined intrusions to halt process flow at specific points during instruction execution, they are expected and can be handled by the user.
  **Major cause of Traps**
  - Trying and catching exceptions in code blocks

## Question 6
**Examples of Interrupt**
- Hardware Interrupts: Keyboard press, power operations on the computer.
- Input/Output : Waiting for input or writing ouput.
- Priority: Wen a process with a higher priority needs CPU time.

## Question 7
**Difference between a Mode switch and Context switch**: **Mode switches** can occur without changing the state of the process itself, I>E a mode switch wouldn't change a running process to a block state, but performs the necessary transiton in the current state the process is in. A **Context switch** is when a process needs to be switched out for a specific reason and all data concerning it is saved and aslo the state changes.
